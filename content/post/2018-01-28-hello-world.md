Hi, I'm Spencer. Welcome to my personal website. This is my first time creating a site like this, and I've been thinking about doing this sort of thing for a while now. I was finally convinced to pull the trigger after reading [this blog post](https://www.johnmackintosh.com/2017-12-30-time-to-shine/) by John MacKintosh, so it became something of a News Years resolution for me. It took some time to get all this up and running, but I believe it will turn out to be a good investment.

This first post is meant to be a mission statement for this site, describing my intent for this project, outside of having an online CV for myself. Here are three main goals I've set for myself.

## 1. Create an online portfolio of data analyses, code, visualizations, etc.
I've done a lot of work for class and on my own that I'm pretty proud of and is suitable to display, but most of it resides either only on my laptop or in a GitHub repository. This brings to mind the old saying about a tree falling in the woods with no one around to here it. So I plan on using this platform as a way to display these accomplishments for public consumption.

## 2. Record my learning process for the sake of posterity
Ever since I started my PhD program, I've learned a great deal about R, C++, LaTeX, using GitHub, project management, and statistical modeling, just to name a few topics. This is all valuable knowledge of course. Similar to the last point, there's little sense in having this knowledge reside only in my head. If I record particularly useful tips, tricks, commands, workflows, etc., then it is that much easier for me to look back on, and even better, to share with others.

Furthermore, I collaborate a lot with my colleagues within my department, and I find myself repeating a lot of what I tell others. And as [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org) put it so well:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you’ve written the same code 3 times, write a function<br><br>When you’ve given the same in-person advice 3 times, write a blog post</p>&mdash; David Robinson (@drob) <a href="https://twitter.com/drob/status/928447584712253440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

## 3. Improve my writing skills
The older I get and the more I learn, the more I realized the importance of good writing. Whether it's in business or academia, the ability to express your thoughts and opinions in a clear and understandable way is invaluable. Now, I consider myself a decent writer. I can whip together a pretty good essay or policy memo when needed. I even maintain a journal for personal use. But the biggest challenge for me is writing in a time-efficient way. I don't even want to admit how long this relatively short post has taken me to write. I'll need to write a lot in the coming years as I progress through my PhD program, and I figure that the only way to improve my skills as a writer is to write more, and write often. 

## That's it for now
Here's hoping for a fruitful career in blogging.

### Appendix: how I made this site

This site is made within [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/) using the [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package by Yihui Xie. The underlying framework is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and I used the [Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) by George Cushen. Go ahead and give it a try. :wink:

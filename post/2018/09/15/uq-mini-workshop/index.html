<p>This summer I was lucky enough to collaborate with Lauren Hund from
Sandia National Laboratories on some work related to uncertainty
quantification (UQ) and Bayesian model calibration. We worked together
to extend ideas on power likelihood methods to a model calibration
problem originally <a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rssc.12273">published earler this year in JRSS
C</a>. Novin Ghaffari, another PhD student at UT, also worked
with Lauren, though Novin worked on a problem of combining subset
posteriors and so his work did not intersect much with mine.</p>
<p>All this work culminated in a mini UQ workshop hosted here at UT, and
organized by our professor Peter Mueller. Some of Lauren&rsquo;s coworkers
from Sandia attended, as well as Brian Williams from Los Alamos
National Laboratories, and Mengyang Gu from Johns Hopkins
University. I gave the first talk of the workshop to introduce the
problem and discuss the work I had done. The main idea is to temper a
misspecified likelihood to achieve nominal coverage of posterior
credible intervals. Novin spoke right after me, and there were talks
for the rest of day, as well as a lot of lively discussion.</p>
<p>This was my first time working on UQ problems, and I am grateful to
both Lauren and Peter for the experience. UQ is not an area of much
active research at SDS here at UT (as far as I know), so this was a
very exciting and eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>Slides from my talk are available
<a href="/files/UQ-mini-workshop.pdf">here</a>. I hope to work further with
Lauren to get a manuscript of our work on the arxiv, and eventually
submit our work for publication in a UQ journal.</p>

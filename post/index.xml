      <description>I recently gave to a talk which counted as my oral examination to officially enter candidacy. This talk mostly concerned work on post-selection inference that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed with my advisor James Scott, but it also briefly introduced some ongoing work concerning posterior summarization.
My committee members are:
 Professor James Scott (advisor) Professor Carlos Carvalho Professor Jared Murray Professor Cory Zigler  Slides from my talk are available here.</description>

      <title>UQ Mini Workshop</title>

      <description>This summer I was lucky enough to collaborate with Lauren Hund from Sandia National Laboratories on some work related to uncertainty quantification (UQ) and Bayesian model calibration. We worked together to extend ideas on power likelihood methods to a model calibration problem originally published earler this year in JRSS C. Novin Ghaffari, another PhD student at UT, also worked with Lauren, though Novin worked on a problem of combining subset posteriors and so his work did not intersect much with mine.</description>

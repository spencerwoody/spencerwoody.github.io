# site_build

All the machinery for constructing my personal website, [`spencerwoody.github.io`](https://spencerwoody.github.io/). The content within the `public` folder gets copied to the [`spencerwoody.github.io` repo](https://github.com/spencerwoody/spencerwoody.github.io). There's probably a more efficient way to do this but honestly I'm just happy to have something that works... :sweat_smile:

Built within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) using the [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The underlying framework is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I used the [Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).
